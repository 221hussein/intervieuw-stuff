Difference between Collection API and Stream API
Collection API is in use since Java 1.2. Stream API is added to Java in version 8.

Collection API is used for storing data in different kinds of data structures. Stream API is used for computation of data on a large set of Objects.

With Collection API we can store a finite number of elements in a data structure. With Stream API, we can handle streams of data that can contain infinite number of elements.

Collection API constructs objects in an eager manner. Stream API creates objects in a lazy manner.

Most of the Collection APIs support iteration and consumption of elements multiple times. With Stream API we can consume or iterate elements only once.
